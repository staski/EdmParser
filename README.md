# EdmParser

A parser for JP Instrument's EDM engine monitoring data. Inspired by https://github.com/wannamak/edmtools.git and http://www.geocities.ws/jpihack/jpihackcpp.txt It has no other dependencies and can be used on macOS and iOS. 
It is used by the [BlueEDM](https://fly.venus-flytrap.de/BlueEDM) App, which allows you to download EDM monitoring data to an iPhone and by [EdmCli](https://github.com/staski/EdmCli), a simple MacOS command line tool for analyzing engine monitoring files
